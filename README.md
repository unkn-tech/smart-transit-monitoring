# 🚌 SmartTransit — Smart Transit Monitoring System for Bengaluru Bus Routes

> An intelligent real-time public transportation monitoring system designed to improve the daily commute experience across Bengaluru bus routes.

---

## 📌 Overview

**SmartTransit** is a full-stack smart public transit monitoring platform built as a major academic project. The system simulates real-time bus tracking, crowd monitoring, traffic-aware ETA prediction, and route analytics for Bengaluru city buses.

The project aims to solve common commuter problems such as:

* ⏳ Unpredictable bus arrival times
* 🧍 Overcrowded buses
* 🚦 Traffic-related delays
* 📍 Lack of real-time transit visibility

Using a modern web-based dashboard and live map interface, SmartTransit provides commuters and transport authorities with actionable transit insights in real time.

# 🚀 Key Features

### 📍 Real-Time GPS Bus Simulation

* Simulates live movement of buses across **4 major Bengaluru routes**
* Dynamic location updates using a custom Node.js simulation engine

### ⏱️ Intelligent ETA Prediction

* Calculates Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)
* ETA adapts automatically based on:

  * 🟢 Light Traffic
  * 🟡 Moderate Traffic
  * 🔴 Heavy Traffic

### 👥 Smart Crowd Estimation

* Monitors passenger capacity
* Classifies buses into:

  * Low Crowd
  * Medium Crowd
  * High Crowd

### 🤖 Smart Bus Recommendation

* Suggests the best bus based on:

  * Lowest ETA
  * Comfortable crowd level
  * Route availability

### 🗺️ Live Interactive Map

* Visualizes:

  * Bus locations
  * Routes
  * Stops
* Powered using **React-Leaflet + OpenStreetMap**

### 📊 Authority Analytics Dashboard

* Displays:

  * Route-wise passenger load
  * Delay statistics
  * Traffic impact trends
  * Operational insights

# 🏗️ System Architecture

The application follows a **Full-Stack Client-Server Architecture**.

### 🔹 Backend

* Acts as an independent REST API layer
* Handles:

  * Bus simulation
  * ETA calculations
  * Crowd estimation
  * Analytics generation
* Stores route and transit data using SQLite

### 🔹 Frontend

* Built as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using React + Vite
* Fetches real-time data from backend every **3 seconds**
* Displays:

  * Live dashboard
  * Interactive maps
  * Transit analytics
